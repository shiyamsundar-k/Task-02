1. Load the rest countries data using your html and script.js file and run a for loop on the data and print all the country name in the console. 

2. Give a write up on Difference between copy by value and copy by reference.

When you assign a variable, it is a reference to an object not the object itself. When you copy an object b = a both variables will point to the same address.

This behavior is called copy by reference value.

when we declare b = a, b will point to a different memory address with the same ‘string’ value right away. So you don’t need to reassign a to point to a different memory address.

This is called copied by value

3. How to copy by value a composite datatype (array+objects).

we can’t clone data in composite data types. To do that spread operator is used, that is three dots (…), 

it spreads the elements of that particular array or object and its values can be used to assign to some other variable.
